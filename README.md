# GriefPrevention Rewards
GriefPrevention-Rewards is a simple and direct Paper/Spigot/Bukkit plugin that allows users to ``/redeem`` once every day in order to claim a
set amount of claim blocks as a daily reward for playing on your server. You can change the amount of blocks in the ``config.yml`` file.

# config.yml
``daily-claims`` - The amount of blocks given when you run ``/redeem``.<br>
``database`` - Currently does not affect anything.<br>
``data`` - USER DATA(BASE). DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.<br>
